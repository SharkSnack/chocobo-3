# Before Playing

### FAQ

#### Is This a New Game?

No, it's a modern remaster of Final Fantasy Fables: Chocobo's Dungeon (Wii / DS).<br/>They adjusted the game's balance, added co-op gameplay, monster collecting, new jobs, etc.

#### What's Up With Chocobo's New Voice?

Yep, I hate the new voice too. But nothing can be done about it, so just get used to it.

#### Is This Game Difficult?

I'd say it's harder than Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, but easier than Shiren, if you're familiar with those series.<br/>Level is retained throughout the main story, but there are challenge dungeons that restrict player level and such.<br/>Overall, it plays more like a JRPG with roguelike controls than an actual roguelike, and bosses are tougher.

#### Can You Just Reload If You Collapse?

Yes, in Normal Mode you can reload your save an unlimited number of times without penalty.<br/>Hard Mode is stricter, and will treat it as if you collapsed if you reload from the same Bookmark 2 times.<br/>※ You might be able to use Cloud Saves to work around the Hard Mode restrictions.

#### Are There Missables?

None of the important stuff in this game is permanently missable.<br/>The dungeons [The Tower in the Sands](/story-dungeons/the-tower-in-the-sands) and [Insatiable Hunger 1](/extra-dungeons/insatiable-hunger) cannot be played again once cleared.<br/>Otherwise, there are just optional story scenes that can only be viewed during certain chapters.

#### Source for Data Found On This Site?

The data was collected via a combination of memory editing, datamining, and player testing.<br/>That said, I don't claim to know everything about the game, so I apologize if there are inaccuracies.

# Beginnings

### The Tower in the Sands

<div class="pageTopImage dungeonPageTopImage2"><img src="../images/areas/tower_1.jpg"/><img src="../images/areas/tower_2.jpg"/></div>

The game whisks you straight into a tutorial dungeon called [The Tower In The Sands](/story-dungeons/the-tower-in-the-sands) after the opening.<br/>It's only 4F (4 floors) deep and it's impossible to collapse, so spend some time checking out menus and controls.<br/>In particular, you'll want to pick up and equip the Rusty Talons and Rusty Saddle found on 0F.

#### 3F - Werebat (Boss)

<div class="pageTopImage"><img src="../images/guide/chapter1/tower_werebat.jpg"/></div>

Werebat has 125 HP or 149 HP on Hard Mode and hits much harder than the Steel Bats on 1-2F.<br/>Open the Ability menu and press L + A to assign a shortcut for Chocobo Kick, then kick the bat until you win.<br/>Cid will fully heal you if your HP gets low, so there's absolutely no danger.
